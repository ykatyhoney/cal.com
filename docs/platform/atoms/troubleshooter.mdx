The Troubleshooter atom helps users debug their availability and scheduling issues. It displays a sidebar where users can select an event type, view their schedule, and toggle connected calendars alongside a large calendar view that visually shows the resulting availability. Essentially, it lets users diagnose why certain time slots may or may not appear as available.

Below code snippet can be used to render the Troubleshooter atom

```js
import { TroubleShooter } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function TroubleShooterAtom() {
  return (
    <>
      <TroubleShooter />
    </>
  );
}
```
